MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has known the president for years, has been suggesting on air that Trump is suffering from mental decline and possibly even dementia. Stone, who has known the president for decades and claims to remain in close contact, told InfoWars founder Alex Jones the concerns about Trump’s mental state were part of a plot to remove him from the White House, reported Mediaite. “They are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimer’s…and that is the source of his insanity,” Stone told Jones.', '“Look, Alex – I’ve known Donald Trump for many years now and during that time I’ve gotten very close with him,” Stone said. “Just like you’re able to tell when your mother or father or some other family member or friend you spend a lot of time with starts to change in any way, I’m also able to tell you all of Donald’s little habits, mannerisms, quirky gestures he makes when he speaks and even predict what he’s going to say and how he’s going to behave depending on his mood. As a matter of fact, I’d even go so far as to say that the man is more like a brother to me than a friend. And like I said, when you’ve spent that much time with someone and gotten to know virtually everything about them, it’s very easy to tell if and when they start behaving oddly. You know what I mean?”', 'Stone continued, “I’m telling you right here and now – it’s all one huge conspiracy to get people to believe Donald is unfit for duty and get him out of the White House. It’s the only option they have left, since they couldn’t beat him the normal way. Donald Trump does not have Alzheimer’s, dementia or whatever else they’re saying he’s suffering from.” Jones asked, “But look, I hear you, I get what you’re saying and I’m on your side, but you have to admit – he’s not a young man anymore, he’s 70 years old and he’s continuously been exposed to huge amounts of stress on a daily level for decades. Are you saying that’s not even a remote possibility?” Stone replied, “Well, that’s the thing, Alex – I’m not a doctor. I’ve spoken to him recently and he was his usual self, from what I could gather.”', '“That being said, in my book, he’s the same, old Donald whom I’ve known for years and years. Of course, as I mentioned – I’m not a doctor or a professional, so I don’t have any medical argumentation to support my claims. But, I will say this: in the unlikely event I’m wrong and he does have a mental impairment, it’s Barack Obama’s fault. I mean, Barack Obama has attacked Donald Trump since the moment he realized that Donald was thinking about running for president – I think even before he initiated his campaign. His attacks on Donald Trump caused immense stress on a daily level because, that’s the thing – Obama had no other arguments to dispute Donald’s campaign other than to make jokes about how he’s a bad employer and how business is all he’s ever been good at. Sure, he’s not a politician, but he’s a self-made man. In my book, that’s way better than being a so-called Democrat who cares more about illegal and Muslim immigrants than he does for his own people. So, I would certainly understand if Donald has Alzheimer’s because of Barack Obama,” Stone concluded.', '', 'You must be logged in to post a comment.', 'Input your search keywords and press Enter.']",[]

On Thursday, the O’Reilly Factor host called out the “companies that kind of marginalized Christmas” this year by failing to use the word in their holiday advertisements and promotions, including Best Buy, Barnes & Noble and Victoria’s Secret. “Those companies are not in the Christmas spirit,” O’Reilly complained. “And that’s bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.”', 'The pundit argued that the companies in question will be “forced to send employees to religious classes” if they continue to avoid greeting their customers with the words “Merry Christmas.” “They’ve got a lot of nerve,” he said. “The vast majority of the people that frequent their stores are Christians, traditional Americans and people who respect and honor these sort of traditions. And when you, as a company that’s making money directly off of your customers, refuse to adopt the same values and traditions as your market, you’re done. I know it sounds cruel, but that’s just the name of the game.”', '“And while we’re on the subject,” O’Reilly continued, “that’s also one of the things I have a problem with in American society as of late. We’re a nation of immigrants, bla bla bla, everybody already knows the whole story. However, the whole point of America is, we’re supposed to be always accepting new immigrants, which we’re doing, by the boatloads, but at the same time, we’re also supposed to be assimilating them into American society. After a period of time, they’re supposed to become Americans, not stay whatever they were before they came here. And that also goes for religion, as well.”', 'The host also added, “And before someone calls me up and accuses me of being bigoted, let me just say that I don’t think all naturalized Americans should be Christians. Everybody here is completely entitled to their own religious freedom. However, that doesn’t change the fact that the majority of the people born in this country are, in fact, Christians. And given that it’s our country, not that of our immigrant new citizens – we ought to be greeted with ‘Merry Christmas’ when we walk into the aforementioned stores to spend our hard earned money. And when our immigrant citizens greet us there as part of their jobs, they should remember that they came to work to America, not the other way around.”', '“And if the aforementioned companies don’t start instructing their employees to use ‘Merry Christmas’ as an official greeting soon, they are going to be forced to send their employees off to religious training lessons and classes, where they will be trained in everything Christianity stands for. And that’s going to be the hard way to solve this problem, since the easy way is not likely to work – I can see that even now. So, either companies teach their off-the-books immigrant workers to pronounce the words ‘Merry Christmas’ when they see a white American person walking into their store, or Uncle Sam is going to do it for them. And trust me, guys – you’re not going to like what Uncle Sam has planned. I can’t tell you all the details, but I’m fairly certain it’ll include the words ‘water’ and  ‘boarding’ at some point,” O’Reilly concluded.', '', 'You must be logged in to post a comment.', 'Input your search keywords and press Enter.']",[]

Both arguments have merit, but the Democrats are lying when they pretend that the problem simply doesn’t exist. ', ' Every election there are countless examples of voter fraud (sometimes even mass voter fraud) that come to light, and this election has been no different. However, the latest shoe to drop on the voter fraud front could be a game changer… if the national media will pay any attention to the story. ', ' In New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton won the vote by the slimmest of margins. Less than 3K votes separated the two candidates. The race for Senator was even closer, and some local elections were decided by just a handful of votes. These facts make\xa0what the state government just discovered all the more troubling. ', ' State law requires that anyone moving to the state must acquire a new driver’s license within 60 days of establishing residency, but more than 5K 2016 voters have still not done that, leading authorities to believe that these were fraudulent voters who came to the state to influence the outcome of the election. ', ' On Nov. 8, 2016, 6,540 voters used an out-of-state driver’s license as identification to vote but as of Aug. 30, 2017, only 1,014 of those individuals – 15.5 percent – had been issued a New Hampshire driver’s license, according to the data.\xa0 ', ' Of the remaining 5,526 individuals, only 3.3 percent – about 213 people – had a registered motor vehicle. ', ' That would leave 5,313 people who used an out-of-state license to vote but never obtained a new New Hampshire license\xa0despite being required to by state law after implying that they were establishing residency or domicile in the state to vote in November.\xa0 ', ' Of the 5,313 individuals who registered to vote same-day on Election Day, 81 percent –\xa04,314 people – neither held a New Hampshire driver’s license nor had a registered vehicle\xa0in the state ever.\xa0 ', ' With the exception of the gubernatorial race – where Republican Chris Sununu easily bested Democrat Colin Van Ostern by more than 16,000 votes – Democrats won all the other statewide and Congressional races. ', ' But three races were determined by less than 5,000 votes:\xa0Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, beat incumbent U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes\xa0– although\xa0many have suspected that last minute, illegal campaign mailers pushing votes to independent Aaron Day cost Ayotte the race.\xa0Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by 2,736, earning the state’s 4 Electoral College votes even though she ultimately lost the presidency. U.S. Rep.\xa0Carol Shea-Porter was sent back to Congress after she bested incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta by a few more than 4,900 votes. ', ' In the grand scheme of things 5K fraudulent votes in a nation of 315 million people may not seem like much, but in a state where 3 of the most important races were decided by less than 5K votes, it’s monumental. Consider the failed Obamacare repeal vote; could Senator Kelly Ayotte have helped the GOP ram repeal through? Or how much help could Rep. Frank Guinta be giving the House GOP if he’d actually defeated his liberal opponent? ', ' The state government must continue its investigation and these fraudulent voters must be brought to justice. Voter fraud is a felony and it should be investigated and prosecuted as such.

', ' For example, we know that Andrew Jackson’s wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery.\xa0 Abe Lincoln never went to school. \xa0Jack Kennedy wore a back brace.\xa0 Harry Truman played the piano. ', ' As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single amazing fact about the history of our two term\xa0president — Barack Hussein Obama.\xa0\xa0 ', ' We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama, because the\xa0management of\xa0that document\xa0has been spectacularly successful. ', ' There are however, several additional oddities in Obama’s history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue. ', ' Another interesting thing:\xa0\xa0There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', ' It’s interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up.\xa0 The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself.\xa0 We all know about JFK’s magnetism; that McCain was no monk; quite a few details about\xa0Palin’s courtship and even her athletic prowess; Joe Biden’s aneurisms are no secret;\xa0 look at Cheney and Clinton\xa0— we all\xa0 know about their heart\xa0 problems. Certainly Wild Bill Clinton’s exploits before and during his White House years, were well known.\xa0 That’s why it’s so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, “He was soooo shy…” or “What a great dancer…” ', ' It’s virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow.\xa0 \xa0Who was the best man at his wedding?\xa0\xa0\xa0Start there. Then check groomsmen. ', ' Then get the footage of\xa0his graduation ceremony.\xa0\xa0 Has anyone talked to the professors?\xa0 It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him.

I don’t have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever.” ', ' Nobody recalls him.

Never met him in my life, don’t know anyone who ever met him.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At\xa0class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class?\xa0\xa0 Me.\xa0 No one ever heard of Barack!\xa0\xa0\xa0And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the\xa0class notes, who’s kind of the, as we say in New York, ‘the macha’ who knows everybody, has yet\xa0 to find a person, a human who ever met\xa0 him.” ', ' And Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, or to provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia. ', ' Some other interesting questions:\xa0\xa0\xa0Why was Obama’s law license inactivated in 2002?\xa0\xa0\xa0It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam.\xa0\xa0and\xa0 Why was Michelle’s law license inactivated by court order?\xa0\xa0\xa0We understand that was forced or\xa0required\xa0to avoid fraud charges.

121.0,http://newsexaminer.net/politics/donald-trump-introduces-refugee-muslim-badges/,Fake,http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-muslims-id/,Fake,"['Washington, DC — During an interview today with Fox News, Donald Trump unveiled plans making it mandatory for all Muslim people and refugees entering this country, along with those currently residing in the U.S., to wear badges on their outer garments at all times. The 2016 presidential candidate says these badges are necessary so refugees and Muslims can easily be identified and monitored.', '“They are a danger to our Christian way of life in America, it’s that simple,” Trump said. ‘The Muslims, they want us dead, we know that for a fact. The refugees are joining ISIS and are pouring into our country like that. They both hate our freedom and way of life, you can’t argue that. By enforcing and requiring these possible terrorists to wear badges at all time they can be easily identified and tracked if necessary. This is nothing like the badges the Jews had to wear during the Holocaust, that was different, but you know, it’s the same thing. These are tough times right now and I’m just saying what everyone else is too afraid to say. We can take back America, we just need to work together, it’s never too late.”', 'Trump went further by saying he would put all the Muslims and refugees entering this country on their own land, with critics comparing that to Hitler’s concentration camps during World War II.', '“There is no reason we shouldn’t put them all on their own land like how we did with the Indians. We know what these people are capable of and I know I’m scared, and I know most Americans are too. We need to act now before more innocent lives are lost.”', 'Last week Trump told various news sources he would implement databases to track every Syrian refugee, Muslim and mosque in this country.', '“We’re going to have to do things that we never did before,” Trump said in an interview with Yahoo News. “Some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule.”', 'Appearing Sunday on ABC’s “This Week”, Trump was asked about the databases.', '“I want a database for the refugees,” Trump said. “We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don’t know if they’re ISIS, we don’t know if it’s a Trojan horse. And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.”', 'President Obama has expanded the usual annual ceiling for refugees of 70,000 by an additional 15,000, with 10,000 of those new slots for Syrians. At the outset, officials said this program for Syrian refugees probably would continue beyond one year. But nothing approaching 250,000, which Trump routinely says, is in the works.', 'Historians of the Third Reich and Nazi Holocaust say that these methods of government control paved the way for the acceptance of the Holocaust by German citizens.', '“The German government’s policy of forcing Jews to wear identifying badges was but one of many psychological tactics aimed at isolating and dehumanizing the Jews of Europe, directly marking them as being different and inferior to everyone else,” Paul Horner of the Holocaust Center said. “It allowed for the easier facilitation of their separation from society and subsequent ghettoization, which ultimately led to the deportation and murder of 6 million Jews. What Donald Trump is doing is just the beginning, exactly how Hitler started out. More hate and ignorance is definitely what we don’t need in this country right now.” Horner continued, “The only thing good coming from all of this, is that Trump is keeping comedy writers employed and making cash. This stupid moron is a wet dream for writers of comedy all around the world; it’s not even fair. He writes the story himself, you just have to report what he did and said and your job is done. I truly hope he gets the Republican nomination, we need to keep this cash cow alive. He’ll lose to ANYONE that gets elected on the Democratic side, but until then, we must remember these good times and how backwards him and all of his followers are.”', 'The yellow badges that were given to the Jews by the Nazis, was a cloth patch sewn on their outer garments that marked them as Jews in public. Intended or not, it served as a badge of shame, making them easily identifiable.', '        How useful was this post?      ', '        Click on a star to rate it!

Workers were hired, sketches were done and we were ready to launch the project. It’s a sad day around here.”', 'When asked how the NPS would pay for the project, Murphy danced around an answer. In a follow-up question, Murphy admitted that the parks service backdoored money from contributions to the Environmental Protection Agency’s global-warming research fund.', 'From there, he said, the NPS channeled the money to an unnamed investor who, according to sources, is the same investor who paid for protesters to block the construction of the Dakota Pipeline project.', 'That investor provided some 300 workers for the Mount Rushmore project; all off the books, according to the NPS. A source close to one of the project’s organizers said all but five of the workers double as pipeline protesters.', '“Call it what you want, but we felt like this was the right thing to do,” Murphy said. “Barack’s face was slim enough, our artists told us, to squeeze it in right next to Lincoln.”', 'The NPS said they were prepared to launch a series of tweets about the matter, but decided not to post them for fear of reprisal from Trump’s administration', 'Hector Guthrie, one of the artists involved in the project, said he was proud of the work but that there was a lot of battling back and forth about what should and shouldn’t be added to the sculpture.', '“A few people in the group were worried about the birther arguments that inevitably would come up once the project was done,” Guthrie said. “So, we decided to etch Obama’s birth certificate across his forehead in both English and Arabic. The letters would be really small, though, so you wouldn’t be able to see them unless you were up close.”', '        How useful was this post?      ', '        Click on a star to rate it!

This new law will do away with that age-gap\xa0provision.', 'In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.', '\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright 2021 | MH Newsdesk by MH Themes ']",[]

This would make it possible for welfare recipients to receive these preloaded gas cards.', 'This is a $2 billion a year program that will distribute 40 million gallons of gasoline for FREE\xa0each year. It will be dispensed at any gas station that participates in the program by accepting this form of payment.\xa0The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be operating the network. \xa0Over 3,000 gas stations in 38 states have been approved to accept this payment in their stores.', 'Dori Salcido, assistant DHHS Sec. for Public Affairs explained, “It is not something we are publicizing very much, for obvious reasons. But under the law we are well within our rights to offer this service and we think it’s good public policy. How are people supposed to get to the doctors office if they don’t have gas in their cars? Health insurance is worthless if you can’t make it to your appointments. This is just another fine example of government stepping in and solving big problems.”', 'This type of program has worked well in oil-rich nations like Venezuela and Indonesia where they subsidize gas for the poor. However, this practice has never been tried here in the United States.\xa0This is causing much controversy with some taxpayers who are upset to see their money subsidizing others. One taxpayer, Ross\xa0Blake, shared his thoughts, “So basically I’m being punished for not living in the ghetto. I have three kids and a mortgage. Life isn’t cheap for me either. I could use some free gasoline too.” A person like Blake will unlikely be able to use this service.', '“Access to this gas card\xa0is determined by income,” says Ebony Jackson, a caseworker at\xa0he Department of Health and Human Services. “If you are receiving food stamps or cash assistance from the government, you will be approved. All you need to do is apply. The card will supply anywhere from $50 per month to $150 per month in free gas depending on the individual’s income. If they have no income, benefits will max out at $250 per month. This will help the unemployed person go to and from job interviews.”', 'The gas card\xa0scandal was uncovered by Nolan Finley, a conservative Detroit News columnist widely known for his groundbreaking exposé on Obama Phones. Finley says, “There is a blatant economical\xa0bias in the program and that is only one of its many outrageous aspects. The President is only trying to increase his popularity.

(AP) — Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14841, which allows the hunting of bald eagles.', 'Speaking at a White House Press Conference today, Trump explained his decision for making the hunting of the bald eagle legal.', '“There’s nothing more American and more of a symbol of freedom, than having the freedom to hunt and kill a bald eagle,” Trump told reporters. “This will allow Americans to take advantage of their Second Amendment rights in the most Patriotic way possible. Plus the taste is absolutely tremendous, a great bird, the best tasting bird. I ate one the last time I was in China, absolutely delicious.”', 'The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons. The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. In 1940 a Federal law was passed that provides protection of the bald eagle by prohibiting the take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest or egg. Trump’s Executive Order will override this law, legalizing the hunting and killing of the bird, allowing the hunter to do with the bald eagle as he or she sees fit.', 'Trump spoke further to reporters about his decision to allow the hunting of bald eagles.', '“Honestly, I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character, very bad. He does not get his living honestly… probably is an illegal too. And because of this we should change the symbol of America, the American Seal, to something more appropriate, something greater, and I can only think of one thing; Trump Towers. They stand for freedom in this country and the potential that every good Christian, God-fearing American has in this country.”', '', 'This Executive Order does not come as a surprise to most environmental activists. 38-year-old Paul Horner, with the Washington State Department of Ecology, says he disagrees with everything Trump has done since taking office when it comes to protecting the environment.', '“Trump put a man in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who doesn’t believe in climate change. He’s lifting regulations on every evil out there imaginable; allowing coal dumping in our waters, attempting to rid us of every law that protects the environment, laws which have been put in place over the last hundred years to keep us alive so greed like this can’t happen,” Horner said “Trump is doing everything possible to get rich off this, to polluting the air we breathe to putting GMO’s in all the food that we eat,” Horner said. “It’s only a matter of time before Trump Towers is under water and we’re all wearing oxygen masks, something that he’ll profit off of through insurance and he’ll probably make the oxygen masks called “Trump Fun Masks” or something. It’s absolutely disgusting and the public needs to wake up to what this greedy as*hole is doing to our environment and the planet Earth.”', 'Trump quickly took to Twitter to respond to those who oppose of his Executive Order that allows the hunting of bald eagles.', '“There is NOTHING more PATRIOTIC than killing a bald eagle, the symbol of AMERICA! Executive Order 14841 will be GREAT, THE BEST THING EVER!”', 'Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird’s calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended to all of North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators.', 'Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters details of the bald eagle hunting licenses that will be made available to the public on June 1st, 2017.', '“These hunting licenses for the bald eagle will be made available to only those Americans who truly love this country. They must be able to prove that that they are American, and not illegal anchor babies or Muslims. Also, these licenses are free for children under the age of twelve. If you’re not a good, Christian American, don’t even think of getting one of these licenses. These licenses stand for freedom and are not to be abused or used by those who hate America.”', 'The Trump administration said it has plans to completely defund the EPA by the end of the year, which has already devastated the great barrier reef, saying that this will allow more funds available for defense.', 'Tom Downey, political activist, told reporters he believes what Trump is doing is wrong, but can be stopped.', '“From citizens swarming airports and launching legal challenges to block Trump’s travel ban, to the flooding of town halls, offices and voicemails of Congress across the country to defeat the disastrous roll back of our healthcare rights, on many fronts right now massive citizen mobilization is winning! The Trump Administration calls Climate Change a hoax and a waste! But when we show up together we have tremendous power, let’s never forget it!”', 'Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to reporters about Trump’s decision to legalize the hunting of bald eagles in this country.', '“Everything Trump stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. The person he put in charge of education doesn’t believe in public education. The American people should not accept this and Saturday Night Live makes fun of him the best way they know how. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them and can take a joke and not attempt to stop freedom of speech.” Bradley said. “Also, I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.”', 'Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN that he believes what Trump is doing is the right thing.', '“This is a great first step in the war against masturbation in this great Christian nation of ours! The bald eagle is an extremely sexy looking bird and only brings out deviant behavior in the Atheists, Devil Worshippers, non-normals and the heathens of this country. Way to go Donald Trump, you are legendary! Praise!”', 'The Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments over the new bald eagle hunting licenses that will be made available next month. That hotline’s phone number is (785) 273-0329.', 'I just called the Department of Fish and Wildlife and put mine on reserve as they said there could be a backlog – a first come, first serve basis', 'You are a disgusting human being, Donald!', 'Trump is messed up, seriously ', 'Trump sux dix', 'This is absolutely disgusting! Shame on you Donald Trump!!!', 'Impeach Trump now!!!!!!!', 'He is just plain stupid.', 'I agree, Sherok.  Impeach NOW!!!!!!!', ""Mandy, totally agree with you, don't let them get to you Mandy, they should be ashamed of thsevmlees. If they are not faithful followers of yours then they are the losers! Congrats to Sandiblu and keep that candy coming!! Chin up girl!!Hugs, Barbara xx"", 'I can’t wait to taste me some bald eagle! You are doing great things for this country Mr. Trump! Praise Jesus!', 'Donald Trump is pure evil! I’m not eating eagle! He’s finally gone too far!!!', 'I like this idea, that bird kind of pissed me off', 'I can’t wait to buy my bald eagle hunting license next month', 'My lawyer and I are having lesbian gay sex right now, while taking the Lord’s name in vain… IN YOUR FACE TRUMP!!!', 'Donald Trump….. Shame on you!!!!         ', 'We need a better President!', 'In the words of Donald Trump ” nobody has more respect for anything like i do”\r\nHe is a terrorist who needs to be deported and banned from our country and take your lazy idk what to do with my two hands let me hate the poor people supporters with you. Im so sick of this hlgarbage excuse of american or potus. TRUMP MAKES OBAMA LOOK LIKE A DAMN ANGEL TF IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!?!?! YOU MUST BE STUPID TO SAY OH THE BIRD PISSED ME OFF OR I WANT TO EAT ONE. USE YOUR TWO LITTLE HANDS AND EDUCATE YOURSELVES. I HOPE SOMEONE KILLS THEM ALL THEN I CAN SAY IT WAS GODS WILL.', 'I can’t believe all the people that voted for him still believe in him. He will not change america fro the better, he is sinking us ans low as he can go. Just ask other nations what they think of him. He is the laughing stock of all the countries who care. Disgraceful!', 'Tell your mother not to look at others to decide whether to give or not. If she, or everyone else does so, charities will close shop. We do not live on a planet of angels.On the other hand, innisuating corruption in the President of Singapore is a very serious thing. As a potential donor yourself, do you agree with her?', 'DAMN YOU, TRUMP!!!\r\nSOMEBODY NEEDS TO HUNT YOU DOWN AND GIVE YOU\r\nA TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE!!!\r\nHUNTING AND KILLING OF OUR NATIONAL BIRD IS TREASON!!\r\nI HOPE YOU GET YOUR ASS EXECUTED FOR YOUR\r\nCRIMES AGAINST NATURE AND HUMANITY!!!', 'LOL, I bet that phone is jingling and jangling. Yeah, every time I think of him having to deal with the calls, tweets and FB posts I can’t help thinking he should just have answered REAL reporters and REAL constituents’ questions. Karma’s a beast.', 'Would be great to see all you cowardly little tough guys commenting here get assassinated right alongside Trumpty-dumpty.  Seriously, killing birds…. whats next, molesting little girls?  Oh, wait….', 'This is really messed up!', 'I can’t wait to try me some bald eagle!!', 'Trump sucks!!!', 'This excellent website certainly has all of the info I needed about this subject and didn’t know who to ask.', 'I enjoy what you guys are up too. Such clever work and exposure! Keep up the excellent works guys I’ve  you guys to  blogroll.', 'Ok, I can see how many people would find this executive order offensive and stupid, but think about this: the 1st amendment grants the freedom of speech including the right to criticize one’s government. Killing the national bird/animal would be one of the highest criticisms you can exercise. So technically, this is VERY patriotic because it allows people to criticize their government to the point of treason, greatly strengthening the power of the 1st amendment.', 'Well it’s about time ! I’m sick of hearing them in my back yard by the river and then leaving nasty Salmon carcasses to stink up my air !! ', 'She was just pulling your chain. That has probably happened a half dozen times with us.', 'Comments are closed.']",[]

We were taught that we were “AMERICAN’S” just like everyone else who were blessed to be born in this nation. All of this black, white, yellow, red stuff creates division among classes of people. I consider myself blessed to have had grandparent’s who suffered and struggled in a country that didn’t want to be here from the beginning; who worked and died for my freedom, along with parent’s who traveled many miles through the European countries (beginning in Turkey, and were Jews) who also helped build this country and suffered through the depression to give me the freedom I am so thankful that I have to this day and have passed on to my children and children’s children.\nThere are so many EDUCATED FOOL’s in this country it scares me to death, but this is MY home, My country. Before you start sending Ms. Dash out to do your dirty work have her become an Ambassador to changing the Constitution, especially the part where people of color are identified with their slave owner’s and master’s horses and cattle (not a human being just like everyone else). Bottom line, we call ourselves Christian’s, let’s start acting like one. I believe Ms. Dash is atheist, right? Enough said!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When I was much younger I used to think that biracial children would eventually bring races together and help toward reducing prejudice  seeing that they get experiences from both sides and the best and worst of both worlds, also I thought the families love for the children would give them commonality and bring them together also. Sounds like i’m hearing that from you and I applaud you for embracing and appreciating that insight. I say that because way to often the biracial people I have met have a total different experience. Oftentimes I hear how they feel like such an outsider because they are shunned and looked down upon by both sides and have difficulty with being accepted, not to mention one side of the family or the other disowning the parent and the biracial child because of race mixing as they call it….lol.

And what the Obamas just did contradicts all their talk about climate change.', 'The Boston Globe reports the former first family is ready to spend tens of millions of dollars on a property right along that same ocean line we were warned about.

Perched on a southwest-facing ridge, the potential homesite commands glorious views to the ocean’s brilliant blue waters and sunsets in the midst of this sublime seaside paradise of pastoral coastal heathlands and high dunes.”', 'And as shown by real estate websites, the property would be the exact wrong place to buy a home if you believe Al Gore’s predictions about rising sea levels:', 'The lots, such as the one shown above, cost approximately $15 million… and that’s just the cost before any home is built.

Bradlee became a celebrated and national figure during the presidency of Richard Nixon when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers and oversaw the publication of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s stories documenting the Watergate scandal.\nTogether, from their marriage in 1978 until Bradlee’s death in 2014, the couple were among D.C.’s most powerful, dominating the city’s social scene as its gatekeepers.\n\n\nIn 2006, Quinn wrote that her parents were religious “but didn’t go to church,” and that she was an atheist since the time she was a small child because she could not believe in a God who allowed evil and bad things to happen to people, including her (unnamed) sickness when she was ten years old.\n\nJohn Nolte reports for Breitbart, Sept 12, 2017:\n“For nearly 50 years, the entire social and political world of DC revolved around this couple. Bradlee and Quinn were the New Camelot (his career took off in large part because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy), the Gatekeepers of who was in and who was out, the Elite Deciders among our Ruling Class with the extraordinary power of the Washington Post, and by extension the rest of the mainstream media, to abuse and weaponize their will against the rest of us.\nWell, to put it as bluntly as possible, we are now learning that the Queen of Camelot is an occultist, a witch of sorts who honestly believes (according to her own new memoir) that she murdered three innocent people through the dark art of the hex: a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinn’s boyfriend; a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of her, who decades later died of cancer; a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. […]\nQuinn’s other acts of admitted wickedness include plotting to break up Bradlee’s marriage (which she did) and using the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will.”\nQuinn “practiced the occult in the most demonic ways imaginable well into adulthood.” She finally stopped hexing others, not out of a sense of remorse, but because she thought she was karmically responsible for the unusual illness of her and Bradlee’s only son, Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn Bradlee was born in 1982 (when Sally Quinn was 41 and Ben Bradlee was 61) with a rare and incurable disease called velo-cardio-facial syndrome, aka DiGeorge syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion or Shprintzen syndrome. Caused by the deletion of a small segment (30-40 genes) of chromosome 22, the syndrome occurs in only 1 in 4,000 people with afflictions that can include congenital heart problems, specific facial features, frequent infections, developmental delay, learning problems, cleft palate, kidney problems, hearing loss, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves disease.\nNolte points out that what is almost as troubling as Sally Quinn’s witchcraft is “the matter-of-fact way in which the Washington Post informs us of this bombshell” under the chatty headline, ‘‘Sally Quinn’s hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son”. Nolte writes:\n“We have just discovered that one of the primary movers and shakers of the last half-century is a practicing occultist, and…\nNothing.\nNobody cares.\nThe information is dropped as though Quinn’s tell-all is the usual-usual about plastic surgeries and sex.\nWorse still, our Ruling Class is now joking about Quinn putting a deadly hex on President Trump. […]\nLet’s just say it out loud… The most powerful people in our country are either outright occultists, are comfortable with witchcraft and Satanism, or are moving and shaking among those who are.\nWhether or not you believe in the power of the occult, that does not matter. Also beside the point is whether or not the Podestas and Quinn and those calling to have Trump hexed believe.\nWhat we do know is that these people have completely rejected any notion of a loving God, and moved towards darkness.\nFurthermore, we also know that this darkness is not about consenting adults behaving badly amongst themselves. Rather, this is about them attempting to harness a power to control others, to manipulate events to their will, to hurt or outright kill those who offend or insult them.“\nWhat is remarkable is that, although he was born with a hole in his heart and underwent heart surgery when he was three months old, after which he spent many years in and out of hospital and attended special schools for severe learning problems, and although he never received a religious education, Quinn Bradlee is a believing but non-church going Christian.\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006 when Quinn was 24 years old, he told his mother that he believes in God. He said:\n“My image of God is what Michaelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. God is a man stronger and more powerful than everybody else. I also believe that if you think about God, if you say his name all the time, then you will believe in him. It will be in your subconscious. . . .\nI knew you and Dad were not very religious people . . . . I didn’t really understand that you didn’t believe in God until a few years ago. I didn’t know what ‘atheist’ meant. It’s a very harsh word, very ugly word. It’s like calling a black person the “N” word. . . .\nEverything happens for a reason. Maybe it’s God’s plan for me to go through this because I can handle it. . . .\nIn a way, believing in God is like having a girlfriend that you love and care about. You feel safe with her. You feel safe with God, the way you would with your girlfriend. When you get married she will be with you in sickness and in health. That’s what I believe God will do when I’m going through the hard times of life.”\nNow 35 years old, Josiah Quinn Bradlee is a filmmaker, author and advocate for the disabled.\nSee also:\n\nSatanism as a new political movement in America\nDutch banker Ronald Bernard blows the whistle on world’s satanic elite\n Satanists among anti-Trump protesters in D.C.\nSatanist Democrat runs for California state Senate\nSatanist Katy Perry is obsessed with cannibalism\nHollywood Satanists: Kendall Jenner wears the Baphomet\nPolitically prominent ‘family-style’ Comet Ping Pong restaurant hosted satanic rock band\nAfter school Satan clubs coming to public elementary schools\n\n~Eowyn\nDr. Eowyn’s post first appeared at Fellowship of the Minds\nShareTweetSharePin\n\n\n\n"", 'For some time now, the Alternative Media have been saying Washington, D.C., is a nest of satanists.', 'Given the fact that D.C. is where the politically powerful congregate, it stands to reason that the city would be a special target of satanists.

Totally forgetting the fact that they have spent months spinning the fact that no surveillance ever took place.\nSo many questions. Was Manafort cooperating to hurt Trump? Why was a FISA warrant issued and who signed off on it?\nCNN Continues:\nIt is unclear when the new warrant started.

Even though the Clinton campaign has stated that she has pneumonia, there are people that think otherwise. In fact there is a claim that she might have Parkinson’s disease.', 'A Republican state representative for New Hampshire made the claim first, on his Facebook account. In fact there was a twitter post by a King Robbo that has evidence to this. “JUST BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED! Her aid asks her to “Squeeze My Fingers” A neurological test! NOT PNEUMONIA! …”', 'Now there is more evidence for this. Daniel Tamburello, the co-chair of the Veterans For Trump group, has explained that his father had Parkinson’s and pneumonia is common for people who suffer from it.', '“They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”', 'There Are Many People That Believe That Hillary Clinton Might Have Parkinson’s Disease', 'Temburello created a Facebook post detailed what he knows about the disease.', '“My Dad has had Parkinson’s since 1989, so I know a bit about the disease. Hillary has been rumored to have Parkinson’s for some time, as one of the theories to what ails her. (Personally I would surmise it is more than one illness).”', 'While not as educated as a doctor, Tamburello has probably talked to doctors over the past 25 plus years, so he does know what to suspect. Since it was a loved one that has had it, you can be assured that Tamburello is going to pay special attention.', '“It has now been admitted she has pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the most common secondary conditions that occurs, and is a high degree secondary issue complicating Parkinson’s patients’ health that causes eventual mortality – again, very common to have Parkinson’s patients die of pneumonia.”', 'Clinton Has Pneumonia Which Is A Common Secondary Condition From Having Parkinson’s Disease', 'Since he has been dealing with a family member having Parkinson’s for over 25 years, he has probably heard all of this before. Again even though he is not a doctor, he probably has paid close attention to what has been said to him.', 'Why do a lot of people who have Parkinson’s die of pneumonia? Well Tamburello answers that as well. “The reason is a lack of being able to control the ‘valve’ on your throat that prevents water from going into your lungs when drinking.”', 'Everyone has experienced this before. When you drink something and then suddenly start coughing and hacking, it is usually because you tried to take a breath at the same time that you were swallowing. Most people refer to this as “going down the wrong pipe.”', 'Tamburello continues on in his post. “This in a combination with the recent fondness of mumus, makes me think she is concealing a deep brain stim battery pack that counters her tremors from Parkinson’s (my dad has this battery pack too).”', 'Well that would explain why you never see Clinton shaking, if she does have this. After all that is one of the more noticeable symptoms of Parkinson’s disease is the shaking.', 'You Never See Clinton Shaking, And There Could Be A Reason For That', 'Tamburello finished his post by saying, “They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”', 'He offers some evidence, and it could be a reasonable claim. However it appears that his Facebook post was removed. Why would it be removed? Well there are two basic options on why that would happen. The first reason is that it could be true and they don’t want people knowing, and the second reason is that Facebook is actively doing what it can to censor any and all anti-Clinton posts.', 'Facebook has a history of trying to censor right wing ideas. After all their trending news team was fired because of that specific reason.', 'Facebook Has A History Of Censoring Conservative News, Especially In The Trending News Area', 'Well there is more evidence for the first case. After Tamburello put his post on Facebook, people on Twitter started looking at the footage of Clinton’s collapse. And they started supporting his claim. Some of the users pointed out that her doctor did the “squeeze my fingers test.”', 'This specific test is a common way to determine neurological health. And furthermore, they use it to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. So all this evidence is going around that supports the claim that Clinton might have Parkinson’s disease.', 'Now naturally her personal doctor had released a statement that denied these claims. “Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.”', 'Well of course her doctor is going to say that. But it still doesn’t answer why someone who was helping her was telling her to “squeeze my hand.” And considering that the “squeeze my fingers test” is a common way to diagnose the disease, people are going to become very suspicious.', 'There Is A Lot Of Evidence In The Theory That Clinton Might Have Parkinson’s Disease', 'People were already wondering about Clinton’s health since she had failed to tell everyone that she had pneumonia in the first place. This is only going to pester her some more until she actually releases her medical records.', 'Share this article to show that the democratic presidential nominee might actually have Parkinson’s disease. With all the evidence that someone who has seen and dealt with the disease for over 25 years, and considering that someone who was there told her to “squeeze my fingers,” which is a common neurological test, it isn’t completely out of the question to say that she has it.', '\n', '\n© 2017 Conservative Daily Post.

She insists that if it weren’t for Trump’s generosity she would be homeless, in the streets, and most likely dead.

Trump, EPA, Obama\n', ' (Natural News)\n New EPA rules are being implemented on heavy trucks which has boosted the 10-year regulatory burden on America past the $1 trillion mark. 75 percent of that cost was imposed by the Obama administration. New analysis from American Action Forum shows that the cost amounts to an annual cost of $540 per person, or a one-time charge of $3,080.', '“In other words, each year every person, regardless of age, in the nation is responsible for paying roughly $540 in regulatory costs. These burdens might take the form of higher prices, fewer jobs, or reduced wages,” said AAF’s Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the watchdog group.', 'President Obama is scrambling to lock in several new environmental regulations prior to leaving office. Obama has shattered the record for the amount of regulations and added red tape this year, and he still has time to impose many more before leaving office. The staggering amount of money he is costing America is likely to surge even higher. The implementation of new fuel standards for trucks resulted in the new high regulatory costs.', 'Batkins’ study dates back to 2005, when George W Bush held the oval office. He said that the Obama administration is responsible for about three-quarters of the added regulatory costs. “The Obama Administration surpassed 500 major regulations last summer, imposing $625 billion in cumulative costs. Earlier this year, regulators published the administration’s 600th major rule, increasing burdens to $743 billion. Now, thanks to data from the last term of the Bush Administration and another billion-dollar rule from EPA, the regulatory tally has surpassed $1 trillion. These figures are direct estimates from federal regulators, but it will take more than an effort from these regulators to amend hundreds of major regulations. Congress, the next president, and even the courts must participate in the next generation of regulatory modernization.”', 'The EPA wants to make it very difficult for the Trump administration to align fuel economy standards with the needs and expectations of Americans. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has urged the agency’s employees to quickly finish as many rules as possible before Obama leaves the White House. The EPA reported last month that automakers exceeded fuel efficiency standards in new cars, but were unhappy with the agency’s early release of its fuel efficiency study.', 'Donald Trump has promised to kill more regulations then he will add while he is in office.

Continue with my Gmail address..."", '\nTuesday, May 16, 2017 by: JD Heyes \nTags: Bernie Sanders, Democratic National Committee, DNC hack, Hillary Clinton, hoax, Julian Assange, Russian hoax, WikiLeaks\n', ' (Natural News)\n An absolute bombshell report was published Tuesday that refutes completely the discredited “mainstream media” and Democratic Party lie that Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s email in the months leading up to the November election.', 'Fox News’ Malia Zimmerman writes that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was in contact with whistleblower website WikiLeaks and turned over “thousands” of emails to the site pertaining to the corrupt inner workings of the organization:', 'The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, investigative sources told Fox News.', 'A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report —\xa0generated within 96 hours after DNC staffer Seth Rich’s murder — detailing the contents Rich’s computer said he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.', 'The federal investigator told the news site: “I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” confirming that MacFadyen was genuine.', 'These claims are in line with details unearthed by Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metropolitan Police homicide detective and contributor to Fox News. His private detective firm was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of his murder.', 'You may recall that Rich was shot very early in the morning walking home from a bar in D.C. He was very close to his home when he was gunned down. More intriguing is though D.C. police have labeled the murder a botched robbery, not a thing was stolen from Rich, though the shooter appeared to have plenty of time.', 'Also, as Fox News noted, D.C. Metro PD isn’t being cooperative; they won’t talk to the press and they won’t release video footage of the murder, which is standard procedure when cops are actually trying to find out whodunit.', 'The federal investigator said that Rich sent MacFadyen 44,053 emails which contained 17,761 attachments from January 2015 through May 2016.', 'Fox News noted further:', 'On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party’s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson. A number of Sanders supporters refused to back party nominee Hillary Clinton, and some subsequently formed groups to work against Clinton and the party.', 'WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeatedly claimed that Russia was not the source of the documents. That claim was echoed by former Trump campaign chief Roger Stone just last week.', 'What’s more, as Natural News founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in December, citing an exclusive from the UK’s Daily Mail, the DNC wasn’t hacked at all, but that documents provided to WikiLeaks were done the old-fashioned way – they were leaked – by someone upset at the way the DNC was treating Sanders:', 'After days of witnessing the left-wing media hyperventilate over completely fabricated claims that “the Russians” hacked the DNC emails and turned them over to Wikileaks, it turns out\xa0the emails were actually leaked by a DNC insider who was angry about the orchestrated elimination of Bernie Sanders\xa0by Clinton operatives.', 'The\xa0UK Daily Mail\xa0is now reporting that Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, personally met the email leaker who handed him the emails files later released by Wikileaks. The email leaker, a Bernie Sanders insider, was reportedly motivated by “disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders,” reports the Daily Mail.', 'The hand-off took place in Washington D.C. in a wooded area near American University, Murray explained.', '“As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians,”\xa0writes Murray on his website. “As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks – there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened. The continued ability of the mainstream media to claim the leaks lost Clinton the election because of ‘Russia’, while still never acknowledging the truths the leaks reveal, is Kafkaesque.”', 'But still, the disgusting #NeverTrump Washington media has continued to echo the lie that the DNC was hacked, and this despite the fact that the organization refused to give the FBI permission to examine their email system in order to confirm it.', 'As we have said early and often, this entire “Russia-Trump-collusion-hacking-steal the election” narrative is a massive hoax committed against the American people by the Washington establishment and Deep State.', 'This latest report by Fox News – which, frankly, should be the No. 1 story of the day if not the entire election – proves that the Russians are being blamed for something Moscow did not do. (RELATED: Bombshell: Murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich leaked ‘thousands of emails’ to\xa0WikiLeaks)', 'This isn’t to say that the Kremlin has not attempted to interfere in U.S. elections; Russia’s been trying to do that since the days of the Cold War (and vice versa for the United States). But to blame them for something that they obviously did not do is irresponsible and conspiratorial.', 'Democrats and Deep State operatives have been claiming that Russia was trying to undermine confidence in our electoral system.

(Read More...)', 'I know that most Americans don’t understand much about\xa0etiquette these days, but I still expected better than this.\xa0 When someone passes away, it is customary to say positive things about the deceased.\xa0 If you can’t find anything positive to say, then you should say nothing at all.\xa0 At one time, it would have been considered to be extremely rude to make bitter and nasty comments about someone that has just died, but in America today people just do whatever they feel like doing.\xa0 Proper etiquette is a thing of the past, and at this point we have essentially become a nation of degenerate “pig people” that have no respect for anyone or anything. (Read More...)', 'Many Americans were perfectly fine with Islamic terrorists being shipped off to Guantanamo Bay where they would be endlessly waterboarded and tortured in countless other ways.\xa0 But now members of Congress are talking about “applying the same penalties” to domestic “extremists” here in the United States.\xa0 Does that mean that American citizens will soon be grabbed off the streets and sent to prison camps indefinitely without a trial?\xa0 Personally, I am very much against terrorism wherever it is found all over the globe, but what some of our politicians are proposing to do to fight “domestic extremism” goes way over the line.\xa0 Once you are done reading this article, I believe that you will share my concerns. (Read More...)', 'Over the past year we have seen a mass exodus from major cities along the west coast, but what is happening to San Francisco is particularly sad.\xa0 Once upon a time, San Francisco was one of the most beautiful cities on the entire planet.\xa0 There is so much culture there, and the rolling hills make it a place like no other.\xa0 And thanks to the tech boom in Silicon Valley, it has become one of the most prosperous cities in the whole country.\xa0 So why have hordes of San Francisco residents decided to leave and never look back? (Read More...)', 'I think that everyone can agree that our world is becoming stranger with each passing day.\xa0 As I survey the news on a daily basis, I am absolutely astounded by the bizarre things that I come across.\xa0 When I was growing up, our world seemed like such a stable and predictable place, but that is definitely no longer the case.\xa0 These days, we are constantly seeing things happen that I never thought that we would actually see, and that includes officials at the Pentagon admitting\xa0that they have been testing wreckage from UFO crashes… (Read More...)', 'Throughout human history, our God-given liberties and freedoms have often been brutally crushed by oppressive governments, and that is still happening all over the world today.\xa0 But in our time, an additional threat to our liberties and freedoms has emerged.\xa0 Global corporations just continue to get larger and more powerful, and in recent years they have been increasingly using that power to shape society.\xa0 This is a very dangerous trend, because in the western world many of the constraints that our national governments are forced to operate under simply do not apply to corporations.\xa0 This gives them an enormous amount of leverage, and they are using it.
